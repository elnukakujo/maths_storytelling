            "What is the main goal of using Bayes\u0027 theorem?": "To incorporate new evidence and update initial assumptions",
            "What is the importance of starting with a belief or an assumption?": "It provides a baseline that can be refined with new data",
            "An environmental scientist believes that a certain region has a low risk of earthquakes based on historical data. Recently, a few small earthquakes have been detected in the area. Should the scientist start to think differently about the earthquake risk in this region? Why or why not?": "No, because a few small earthquakes don\u2019t necessarily change long-term risk",
            "How does observing additional outcomes, like drawing marbles or analyzing purchases, impact beliefs in the Bayesian approach?": "Not sure",
            "Imagine a doctor is reviewing test results for a rare disease. The test is accurate 95% of the time but also produces false positives 5% of the time. If the disease is very rare in the general population, should the doctor immediately assume a positive test means the patient likely has the disease? Why or why not?": "Yes, because the test\u2019s accuracy is high enough to trust the result without additional context"
