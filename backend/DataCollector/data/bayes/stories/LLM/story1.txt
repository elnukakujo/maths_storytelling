You're a detective trying to solve a murder case. You have two suspects: John and Sarah. You have two pieces of evidence: a torn piece of fabric near the crime scene and a suspicious email on Sarah's phone. The fabric is 90% likely to be from John's jacket, and the email is 80% likely to be from Sarah's account. You're not sure which is which. You update your beliefs based on the new evidence. If you find a matching fabric swatch from John's jacket, your probability of John being the killer increases to 95%. If you find a matching fabric swatch from Sarah's jacket, your probability of Sarah being the killer increases to 92%. What changed? (Hint: think about the probability of each suspect being the killer before and after the new evidence.)

This story illustrates the Bayesian property: the probability of a hypothesis (e.g. John being the killer) updates based on new evidence, and the new probability is proportional to the old probability times the likelihood of the new evidence given the hypothesis.
