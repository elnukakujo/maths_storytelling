A young girl goes to a hermit with a coin, hoping to find out if her coin is biased: she's trying to find out if flipping a coin leads to both sides equally half the time, or if it's more likely to land on a specific side.
“Mr Ermite,” she says, ”how can I determine if my coin is biased?”
The hermit, an adept of the Bayesian approach to probability, replies:
“Well, at the moment, you don't have any information about your coin. But I suggest you make a series of throws to refine the knowledge you have about the coin and make an informed conclusion.”
“How can I do that?” asks the little girl.
“Thanks to the formula of Bayes, our prophet!” replies the hermit. “Start by assuming that you know nothing about the coin, i.e. that it has an arbitrary chance (between 0 and 100%) of falling on heads. You then make a series of throws and note down each result. Bayes' formula allows you to evaluate the probability associated with your toss results, given the assumption you've made about the coin.”
He concludes:
“You can then take advantage of this formula to fine-tune your a priori about the coin: if your throws were very unlikely, then your a priori should be modified. Conversely, if your throws were almost guaranteed, then you can be confident in your a priori. In other words, you use your experiences to refine your preconceived notions. In other words, you use your experiences to refine your assessment of the coin's bias."
