Should the scientist start to think differently about the earthquake risk in this region? Why or why not?",
      "options": [
        "Yes, because recent events suggest that the risk might be higher than previously thought",
        "No, because a few small earthquakes don’t necessarily change long-term risk",

If the disease is very rare in the general population, should the doctor immediately assume a positive test means the patient likely has the disease? Why or why not?",
      "options": [
        "Yes, because a positive test result confirms the disease with high accuracy",
