Imagine you're a hiker trying to reach the top of a mountain. You have a map that shows the steepness of the slope at each point. You start at the bottom and take a step up, but you're not sure which direction to go. You try moving up the slope, but it's too steep and you fall back down. You try moving down, but it's too flat and you don't gain much ground. You repeat this process, adjusting your direction at each step, until you reach the top. This is like the gradient descent algorithm: you start at a point (the bottom of the mountain), and at each step, you move in the direction of the steepest slope (the negative gradient of the function you're trying to optimize). You keep moving until you reach the top (the minimum of the function).
