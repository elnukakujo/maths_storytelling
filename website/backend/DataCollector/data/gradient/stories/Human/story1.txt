Imagine an army of archers on a hilly terrain. This terrain represents the surface of a two-dimensional function and, as with the function, the slope of the terrain varies from place to place. Let's assume that the archers are standing still and pointing their bows in the direction of the steepest slope of the terrain. 
If the archers are instructed to string their bows in proportion to the slope of the terrain where they are, then the army of archers represents the gradient of the terrain, i.e. the field of arrows whose direction is that of the greatest upward slope of a function, and whose length is therefore the intensity of this slope. 
At the top of a hill, in the hollow of a valley and when the terrain is flat, archers have no direction in which to aim their bows: the gradient is zero at these points.
