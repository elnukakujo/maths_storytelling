In Middle-earth, the master smith Celebrimbor discovered a mysterious ring in his forge. He realized that the ring’s power could be determined by measuring the probability of defeating Orcs while using it. However, he only knew that there were k distinct possible probabilities (powers).
Testing the ring’s powers recklessly could be dangerous, so he decided to use an ancient elven method—a Bayesian approach. He began by assuming each possible power was equally likely.
With each careful experiment, he observed whether an Orc was defeated or not. After each outcome, he updated his beliefs using the magical Bayes formula that he had discovered on a wall of Eregion. As Celebrimbor continued this process, his understanding grew. Each experiment refined his beliefs, and the updated probabilities began to reveal the ring’s true power. Finally, the numbers clearly pointed to the true power of the ring. He had uncovered the ring’s secret.
He shared his findings with Galadriel, showing how careful observation and calculation could reveal mysteries that might shape the future of Middle-earth.
